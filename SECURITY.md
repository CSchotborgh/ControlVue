## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. Please follow these guidelines when reporting security issues:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to: security@edgerack.example.com (replace with actual contact)
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Provide steps to reproduce the issue if possible

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., authentication bypass, SQL injection, XSS)
- **Location** (specific files, endpoints, or components affected)
- **Impact assessment** (what an attacker could accomplish)
- **Steps to reproduce** (detailed proof-of-concept)
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution**: Target 30 days for critical issues, 90 days for others

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Session Management**: HTTP-only cookies with secure settings
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with salt rounds
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin and operator role separation
- **Session Timeout**: Automatic logout after inactivity

### Data Protection

- **Database Security**: Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- **Input Validation**: Zod schema validation on all inputs
- **Output Encoding**: Proper escaping of user-generated content
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: TLS encryption for all communications

### Infrastructure Security

- **CORS Policy**: Strict cross-origin resource sharing rules
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive HTTP security headers
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive information in error messages

### Code Security

- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scans of npm packages
- **Static Analysis**: Code review for security patterns
- **Secure Defaults**: Security-first configuration approach
- **Minimal Privileges**: Least privilege principle throughout

## Security Headers

The application implements the following security headers:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

## Common Vulnerabilities Addressed

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Prevention**: Input sanitization and output encoding
- **CSP Headers**: Content Security Policy implementation
- **React Protection**: Built-in XSS protection in React

### SQL Injection
- **Prevention**: Parameterized queries with Drizzle ORM
- **Input Validation**: Zod schema validation
- **Least Privileges**: Limited database user permissions

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **SameSite Cookies**: CSRF protection through cookie settings
- **State Validation**: Server-side state verification
- **CORS Policy**: Strict origin controls

### Authentication Bypass
- **Session Validation**: Server-side session verification
- **Secure Cookies**: HTTP-only and secure cookie flags
- **Rate Limiting**: Brute force protection

## Secure Configuration

### Database Security

```typescript
// Secure database configuration
const dbConfig = {
  ssl: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
  connectionLimit: 10,
  acquireTimeout: 60000,
  timeout: 60000,
  reconnect: true
};
```

### Session Configuration

```typescript
// Secure session configuration
const sessionConfig = {
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  cookie: {
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    httpOnly: true,
    maxAge: 1800000, // 30 minutes
    sameSite: 'strict'
  }
};
```

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs on both client and server
2. **Error Handling**: Never expose sensitive information in error messages
3. **Logging**: Log security events without exposing sensitive data
4. **Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies updated to latest secure versions
5. **Code Review**: Implement security-focused code review process

### For Deployment

1. **HTTPS Only**: Never deploy without TLS encryption
2. **Environment Variables**: Never hardcode secrets in source code
3. **Database Security**: Use strong database passwords and restricted access
4. **Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring and alerting
5. **Backup Security**: Encrypt and secure backup data

### For Users

1. **Strong Passwords**: Use complex passwords for all accounts
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep the system updated with latest security patches
3. **Network Security**: Deploy on secure networks with proper firewall rules
4. **Access Control**: Limit user access to necessary functions only
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor system logs for suspicious activity

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process:

1. **Initial Report**: Vulnerability reported confidentially
2. **Investigation**: We investigate and confirm the issue
3. **Fix Development**: Security patch developed and tested
4. **Notification**: Affected users notified before public disclosure
5. **Public Disclosure**: Details published after fix is deployed

### Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate security researchers who:

- Report vulnerabilities privately first
- Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure
- Provide constructive feedback and assistance
- Avoid accessing or modifying other users' data

## Security Updates

### Update Process

1. Security patches are developed as high priority
2. Updates are tested thoroughly before release
3. Critical updates may be released outside normal schedule
4. Users are notified of security updates via multiple channels

### Notification Channels

- GitHub repository releases
- Security advisory notifications
- Email notifications to registered administrators
- System dashboard notifications

## Compliance

### Industry Standards

- **OWASP**: Following OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
- **NIST**: Aligned with NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- **ISO 27001**: Security management best practices
- **Industrial Standards**: IEC 62443 for industrial cybersecurity

### Regular Assessments
